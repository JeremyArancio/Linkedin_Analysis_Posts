# Linkedin_Analysis_Posts

What makes a Linkedin post good ?

In this project, we study Linkedin posts from american influencers like Simon Sinek or Richard Branson to highlight what makes a Linkedin post good.  

The final notebook is defined as 0_.ipynb and summarize all notebooks I used during this project as drafts. Feel free to check them too if you want.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle
