# Linkedin_Analysis_Posts

What makes a Linkedin post good ?

In this project, we study Linkedin posts from american influencers like Simon Sinek or Richard Branson to highlight what makes a Linkedin post good.   
We performed :

⭐ Data cleaning   
⭐ Exploratory Data Analysis   
⭐ Influence of adding aa media to a post tested with an hypothesis test  
⭐ Text preprocessing  
⭐ Phrase modeling  
⭐ Topic modeling using LDA  

The final notebook is defined as 0_Project_Notebook.ipynb and summarize all notebooks I used during this project. Feel free to check these drafts.  

Drafts are stored inside the "Development" folder. A lot of notes are added relatively to NLP

The dataset can be found on Kaggle

IMPORTANT NOTE : 
because the file was too large for github, i suggest you to download the dataset directly from Kaggle with the link, and to pickle the csv file into your repository.
